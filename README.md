# rung

A ladder of checkpoints for learning a language — not a timeline. First pair:
**Hindi (L1) → Marathi (L2)**. A fully offline, installable, mobile-first PWA:
no backend, no accounts, no audio, no runtime AI. Built by one person, for one
friend.

*rung* (formerly *Shidi*, शिडी — Marathi for "ladder") names the core metaphor: a
fixed sequence of 10 modules ("rungs"), each exited only by **writing** a novel
"11th sentence" of the same complexity, verified by a human.

## Start here

| Doc | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`docs/PRD-engineering.md`](docs/PRD-engineering.md) | Canonical engineering PRD — features F1–F9, phases P0–P5 |
| [`docs/PRD-design.md`](docs/PRD-design.md) | Canonical design PRD — flows, screens, components, tone |
| [`docs/01-plan.md`](docs/01-plan.md) | Implementation plan: stack, layout, data contracts, Devanagari primer. **Read before your first ticket.** |
| [`design/`](design/) | Design mockups + tokens (added by Rishabh as milestone D completes) |
| [`docs/design-contract.md`](docs/design-contract.md) | How to build UI against the design package — tokens, prototype fidelity, mobile rules |

## Development

**Prerequisites:** Node **≥ 20** (enforced by `engines.node`) and npm. No other
runtime, no backend, no env vars.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
```

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server with HMR |
| `npm run build` | Typecheck (`tsc -b`) then production build into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the built `dist/` locally |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript only — strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` |
| `npm run test` | Vitest (jsdom + Testing Library), single run |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (flat config), Prettier-compatible |
| `npm run format` | Prettier write across the source tree |
| `npm run content:validate` | Schema v5 + cross-checks over `content/*/modules/*.json` |

Two rules the scaffold bakes in, before you write a component:

- **Tokens only.** `src/main.tsx` imports `design/tokens.css` *in place* — `design/`
  is read-only and re-copied wholesale, so importing it directly means token updates
  land with zero copy step. Style with `var(--*)`; no hard-coded hex, px or font names
  anywhere in `src/` (`docs/design-contract.md`).
- **One brand constant.** `src/brand.ts` exports `BRAND` — the only place the product
  name lives. Page title, manifest and export filenames all read from it.
- **Content has a contract.** `content/schema/module.schema.json` (JSON Schema draft
  2020-12) is the frozen shape of a module; `tools/validate.ts` adds the checks a schema
  cannot express (filename ↔ id, the 10-sentence / pool ≥ 6 budget and its `fixture: true`
  relaxation, full enrichment for M1–M3, rule-index ranges). Run `npm run content:validate`
  before opening any content PR — one line per file, then `CONTENT <n>/<m> ok`.

## How work happens

- Every change is a **GitHub issue**; one PR per issue; PR title references the
  issue; **squash-merge**; `main` is always deployable.
- Issues live in milestones **P0–P5** (+ **Design follow-ups**, Rishabh). Labels:
  one `epic:*` + `type:*` + `phase:*` per issue (see design/github-issues-checklist.md).
- **Picking your next ticket:** open issues in the lowest unfinished milestone
  → no assignee → every issue linked under "Depends on" is closed → assign
  yourself, branch, go.
- The **7 product invariants** (identical in both PRDs, §2) are contractual.
  Politely reject scope creep: no audio, no runtime AI, no backend, no
  gamification, no calendar framing.

## Quick facts

- Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript PWA; all state in `localStorage`; content is
  static, native-speaker-verified JSON. Details and rationale: `docs/01-plan.md`.
- The app only ever gives deterministic, pre-authored feedback (Invariant 4).
  Novel sentences are verified by humans via a designed copy-paste hand-off.
