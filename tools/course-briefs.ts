/**
 * Per-course, per-module authoring briefs (#109) — the course-specific half of the
 * generation prompt. `generate-prompt.ts` renders one of these into a complete prompt;
 * everything here is what a schema or an index CANNOT say: what the module is FOR, which
 * sentence patterns it may use, and where the L1 helps or misleads.
 *
 * Titles and jobs mirror `content/<courseId>/levels.json` verbatim (the test enforces it) —
 * levels.json stays the single source of the ladder, and a brief only adds the authoring
 * guidance on top.
 *
 * Four courses are briefed: hi-mr through L2, and en-es, en-ar and hi-en L1 only. The L2/L3
 * module lists are RATIFIED (#112 closed [Q1] — titles, jobs and sequence in levels.json are
 * final), and a level's briefs are written when its authoring project starts: a brief encodes
 * pattern-and-interference pedagogy that should be planned against the verified ladder below it,
 * not ahead of it. hi-mr's L2 briefs (#295) are the first written to that rule — planned against
 * the finished L1 index (215 surfaces through L1-M10) and the L1 review chain; hi-mr's L3 waits
 * for a verified L2. en-ar's and hi-en's own L2/L3 lists are still placeholder text (PRD §5) and
 * are not briefed either. The CLI says exactly this when asked for a course or module without a
 * brief.
 *
 * ## Three rules these briefs are written to, learned the hard way on hi-mr
 *
 * 1. **Every example is checked against the rule it illustrates.** M5's brief once illustrated
 *    "the transitive past agrees with the OBJECT" with `मी चहा प्यायलो` — a form that agrees
 *    with the speaker, i.e. the opposite of the rule beside it (docs/07-llm-review-L1-M1-M5.md,
 *    "The #110 adjudication"). A brief seeds every future prompt, so a self-contradicting
 *    example propagates.
 * 2. **A rule must be TRUE first and memorable second.** The third Marathi review
 *    (docs/08-marathi-third-review.md) found the Marathi itself flawless and every defect in the
 *    layer around it: three module rules named the wrong grammatical role because they were
 *    written as slogans ("agrees with the SPEAKER" for what is subject agreement). Spanish
 *    teaching is unusually rich in slogans that are memorable and false — "ser is permanent,
 *    estar is temporary", "-o is masculine, -a is feminine", "the preterite is for completed
 *    actions", "gustar is just backwards". Each brief below names the slogan its module will
 *    attract and states the law the slogan replaces.
 * 3. **Plan homographs against the word index, not against the JSON.** The index is cumulative
 *    and FIRST OCCURRENCE WINS (`tools/content-build.ts`), so the earliest module to teach a
 *    surface owns the "why" note every later module's learner sees — a later row for the same
 *    spelling with a different meaning is unreachable, and the learner is shown a note that is
 *    false of the sentence in front of them (the `का` bug, review 08 correction 4). Surfaces are
 *    normalised by `src/engine/surface.ts`: case is folded, edge punctuation is dropped, and
 *    ACCENTS ARE KEPT — so `qué`/`que`, `cómo`/`como`, `sí`/`si`, `él`/`el`, `está`/`esta` are
 *    distinct entries only as long as the accent is actually written. Spanish's true collisions
 *    (`a`, `mañana`, `por`, `como`, `quiero`) are assigned to an owning module in the notes
 *    below, and a multi-token surface (`Me llamo`, `por la mañana`, `por favor`) is the tool for
 *    keeping the bare word free for whoever should own it. Romanized Arabic is exposed on two
 *    further seams that Spanish is not — hyphen parts and the apostrophe classes — so en-ar's
 *    index rules get their own section below. English has two of its own — contractions, which
 *    survive normalisation as ONE token (`don't`), and a stock of tiny homographs (`to`, `do`,
 *    `have`, `that`, `it`) — so hi-en's get theirs.
 *
 * ## Why the en-es ladder teaches what it teaches
 *
 * The ten communicative jobs are levels.json's and are mirrored verbatim; what a brief adds is
 * WHICH English→Spanish delta each job carries. The sequence is ordered so that each pressure
 * point lands in the module whose job cannot be done without it: pro-drop and `gustar` in M1
 * (the first verb the learner writes, and the first "I like"), `ser` vs `estar` in M2 (wellbeing
 * is the question that forces the choice), gender and article/adjective agreement in M3 (every
 * want names a noun), present-tense conjugation across persons plus reflexives and the personal
 * `a` in M4 (a day is other people and getting up), preterite vs imperfect in M5 (the level's
 * richest interference zone — one English past, two Spanish ones), `ir a` + infinitive in M6,
 * `estar` + location and `hay` in M7 (M2's split at its most mechanical), price agreement in M8,
 * `porque` / `por eso` in M9, and recombination into 2–3 sentence turns in M10. `por` vs `para`
 * and the subjunctive are deliberately OUT of L1: neither is needed by any of these ten jobs,
 * and importing them would spend the word budget on a contrast the learner cannot yet frame.
 *
 * en-es's own `content/en-es/modules/L1-M1.json` started as a four-sentence `fixture: true` seam
 * proof, and was replaced rather than extended: #206 authored M1 fresh to the full ten sentences
 * against the brief below, and #195 graduated the course out of `fixture: true` altogether.
 *
 * ## en-ar: the two decisions a brief must settle before any Arabic is written
 *
 * ### 1. The variety is Modern Standard Arabic — RATIFIED (#198), not a per-module choice
 *
 * Arabic forks in a way Spanish and Marathi do not: MSA is what is written and universally
 * understood but nobody speaks it at home, while a dialect (Egyptian, Levantine) is what a learner
 * would actually say. This course teaches **MSA**, and no module may quietly switch:
 *
 * - It is already ratified elsewhere and a brief may not contradict it — `content/courses.json`
 *   declares the scheme as "ALA-LC-flavoured Modern Standard Arabic", and the seam-proof fixture
 *   is MSA throughout (`uḥibb`, `urīd`, `anā min al-Hind`).
 * - Only MSA has an agreed spelling, and this course prints a native Arabic line under every
 *   romanized sentence (#196/#197). A dialect course would have to invent an orthography for the
 *   quiet line, and two authors would spell it two ways.
 * - One MSA course serves every learner. Choosing Cairo or Beirut forks the course by region on
 *   grounds the ladder cannot supply.
 *
 * The honest objection — that the ten jobs of L1 are CONVERSATIONAL, and conversational MSA is a
 * register nobody uses — is answered by pinning the register rather than the variety. L1 is
 * **spoken-simple MSA**: the educated-neutral Arabic a teacher or a newsreader would say out loud.
 * Concretely, and every module inherits this: pause forms with NO case endings (`al-bayt`, never
 * `al-baytu`), no dual except the counted "two" in M8, no passive, no `lam`/`laysa` negation, no
 * literary vocabulary, and sentences short enough to be said. Where the MSA form is understood
 * everywhere but sounds formal in the street, the sentence's `usage` line says so in words — it
 * never smuggles the dialect form into `display`.
 *
 * ### 2. The romanization scheme, stated once, because it is also an index contract
 *
 * `content/courses.json`'s `romanizationNote` is the declared scheme and the prompt quotes it
 * verbatim; these briefs pin the four points it leaves to an author, chosen so that every spelling
 * ROUND-TRIPS through `src/engine/surface.ts` (one word → one key, forever):
 *
 * - **Write whatever carries the person; drop whatever carries only case or mood.** So the
 *   perfect's person suffix is written in full (`dhahabtu` I went · `dhahabta` you-m ·
 *   `dhahabti` you-f — three persons, three surfaces), while the imperfect's indicative `-u` is
 *   not (`uḥibb`, not `uḥibbu`; the person is already in the `u-`/`tu-`/`ya-` prefix). Writing
 *   iʿrāb instead would give `baytun`/`baytan`/`baytin` — three index entries for one word.
 * - **Short vowels are always written.** `surface.ts` folds case but never touches diacritics, so
 *   `min` (from) and `man` (who) stay two words only as long as both vowels are on the page.
 *   Long vowels are `ā ī ū`; the emphatics and pharyngeals are `ḥ ṣ ḍ ṭ ẓ`.
 * - **`ʾ` is hamza and `ʿ` is ʿayn, and they are different letters.** `surface.ts` folds the
 *   hamza class to `'` and the ʿayn class to `ʿ` and never merges the two (#116 [Q3]) — so `māʾ`
 *   (water) indexes as `mā'` and stays distinct from `mā`. Never write a plain `'` for ʿayn and
 *   never use a curly quote. Word-INITIAL hamza is not written (`anā`, `urīd`, `uḥibb`), matching
 *   the fixture; medial and final hamza is (`māʾ`, `masāʾ`, `qaraʾtu`).
 * - **Three exemptions from "no case endings", because they are lexical, not grammatical:** the
 *   adverbial `-an` (`marḥaban`, `shukran`, `ghadan`, `dāʾiman`), frozen expressions
 *   (`as-salāmu ʿalaykum`), and the verb person-suffixes above.
 *
 * ### 3. Arabic's own index seams — `al-`, the clitics, and the multi-token save
 *
 * `surfaceIndexKeys` indexes a hyphenated surface AND each of its hyphen parts, all pointing at the
 * same word row, first occurrence winning. That makes the hyphen the course's main planning tool
 * and its main hazard, and it yields one law every module obeys:
 *
 * - **The first word carrying a clitic owns that clitic's bare key, so its `note` must define the
 *   clitic and not just the word.** `al-Hind` (M1) indexes `al-hind`, `al` and `hind`, so the `al`
 *   key answers for every article in the course; `bi-khayr` (M2) owns `bi` for M8's `bi-kam`;
 *   `sa-adhhab` (M6) owns `sa`; `li-ʾanna` (M9) owns `li` for `li-dhālika`.
 * - **The bare noun is an alias, not a rival.** `al-qahwa` also indexes `qahwa`, so a later
 *   `urīd qahwa` resolves to the same row — which is why that row's `forms` list both, and its
 *   note must be true of the article-ed and the bare form alike.
 * - **Sun-letter assimilation is spelling here, not just pronunciation.** `ash-shāy` and
 *   `al-shāy` are two different words to the build. Write the assimilated form always.
 * - **Elision is never written.** Say `fī al-madrasa` even though it is pronounced *fi l-madrasa*;
 *   the elided spelling would be a second surface for the same word. The `sound` field is where
 *   the elision belongs.
 * - **`wa` ("and") is written as a free word** even though Arabic script joins it — one clean `wa`
 *   key instead of a fresh hyphenated surface for every word it attaches to. The `script` line
 *   still writes it joined; `script` is never indexed (`content-build.ts`).
 * - **A multi-token surface is the tool for keeping a bare word free**, exactly as in en-es:
 *   `ṣabāḥ al-khayr` (M2) leaves `ṣabāḥ` for M4's `fī aṣ-ṣabāḥ`, and `min faḍlika` (M8) leaves
 *   M1's `min` ("from") owning `min`. The resolver's longest-match-first walk takes the phrase
 *   whole wherever it appears.
 *
 * ### Why the en-ar ladder teaches what it teaches
 *
 * The jobs are levels.json's, mirrored verbatim; the brief adds which English→Arabic delta each
 * job carries. The vanishing present copula and the person-inside-the-verb land in M1 (the first
 * sentence a learner writes has no "is" in it), sun letters and gendered address in M2 (a greeting
 * is addressed to a man or a woman and cannot dodge it), gender agreement on adjectives and verbs
 * plus `lā` negation in M3 (every want names a noun), the imperfect across persons in M4, the
 * perfect's suffix conjugation and `kāna` in M5 (the copula comes back), `sa-`/`sawfa` in M6, the
 * iḍāfa, place prepositions and `ʿind-` possession in M7, counting and its gender polarity in M8,
 * `li-ʾanna`/`li-dhālika` in M9, and recombination into turns in M10. Kept deliberately OUT of L1:
 * the dual (except M8's counted "two"), the passive, `lam`/`laysa` negation, the full case system,
 * and broken plurals as a system — plurals appear only as vocabulary the sentences need.
 *
 * en-ar's own `content/en-ar/modules/L1-M1.json` started as a four-sentence `fixture: true` seam
 * proof (#118), not a first draft: #199 re-authored M1 fresh to the full ten sentences against the
 * brief below — the seam proof's four frames are the only part that survived — and #202 graduated
 * the course out of `fixture: true` altogether.
 *
 * ## hi-en: the four decisions a brief must settle before any English is written
 *
 * hi-en (#267–#273) is the first course whose L2 is the language these briefs — and hi-mr's own
 * module notes — are written in. That inverts one habit and exposes two index seams the other three
 * courses never met, so the decisions are stated once here and repeated in the notes, because a
 * prompt only ever shows an author the notes.
 *
 * ### 1. The language of every field — Hindi teaches, English is the thing taught
 *
 * The language law (#186/#196, `src/langLaw.test.tsx`): the document speaks the course's L1 (`hi`),
 * every L2 line declares `en`, and unlabelled prose inherits the L1. So in hi-en **every teaching
 * field is Hindi, in Devanagari** — `rules[].text`, word `note`, `trap`, `sound`,
 * `variations[].changed`, `mistake.why`, `usage`, `mnemonic` and `cue` — and English appears ONLY in
 * the L2 slots: sentence / word / variation / mistake / pool `display`, and word `forms`. A Hindi
 * field may quote the English word it is explaining (`like` का मतलब पसंद करना); quoting is not
 * switching.
 *
 * hi-mr's modules write `rules[].text` and word `note` in English (`content/hi-mr/modules/L1-M1.json`,
 * `rules[0]`: "Word order is Subject–Object–Verb, exactly as in Hindi…") — a quirk tolerated for one
 * bilingual learner — and **hi-en must NOT copy it**: here an English note about an English word is
 * the lesson explaining itself in the language the learner does not yet have, and on screen that
 * note inherits `lang="hi"` and is read in a Hindi voice. M1's first note and M10's last say so.
 *
 * Two field rules follow from the L2 being English:
 *
 * - **`glossEn` is OMITTED on every hi-en sentence.** #268 made it optional where `l2Tag` is `en`
 *   and the build (`checkGlossEn`) still requires it for every other L2; an English gloss of an
 *   English line is the hero line twice, and Sentence Detail drops the paragraph when the key is
 *   absent.
 * - **`literal` is the Hindi words in ENGLISH order** — `मेरा नाम है रोहन` under `My name is Rohan`,
 *   `किताब है पर मेज़` under `The book is on the table` — the same device as hi-mr's
 *   `मेरा(नपुं.) नाम रोहन है` and en-es's `I call-myself Rohan` (the L1's words in the L2's order),
 *   pointed the other way. It is the most useful line this course has, because the whole delta of
 *   Hindi→English is ORDER: the verb moves to the middle and every postposition becomes a
 *   preposition. Carry it on every M1–M3 sentence; from M4 it is optional and still the right tool
 *   wherever the order moves (M7's prepositions, M9's one-connector rule). Hyphenate a multi-word
 *   Hindi gloss of one English word (`मैं पसंद-करता-हूँ चाय`), as en-es hyphenates `call-myself`.
 *
 * The prompt's own Script section already says the other half — `display` is English, `cue` is
 * Hindi, `script` unused — so a brief need not repeat it.
 *
 * ### 2. Contractions are single index surfaces — one policy for the whole course
 *
 * `src/engine/surface.ts` strips EDGE punctuation only, folds `’` to `'` and lowercases, so `don't`,
 * `I'm`, `isn't`, `it's` are each ONE token and ONE index key — `I'm` never lands on `I` or on `am`.
 * The policy, ratified here and repeated in the notes:
 *
 * - **`display` uses the contraction a fluent speaker would say** — `I'm fine`, `I don't want tea`,
 *   `He doesn't get up early`, `I didn't go`, `It's on the table` — and writes the full form only
 *   where a contraction is impossible (`Yes, I am`: sentence-final `am` never contracts) or where the
 *   uncontracted word IS the module's lesson (M1's `I am a student`, because `am` is what M1 teaches;
 *   M6's `I will go`, because `will` is; M5's `was not`, because `was` is).
 * - **A contraction is its own word row, in the module that introduces it, and that row's `forms`
 *   lists BOTH shapes** — `don't` · `do not`; `I'm` · `I am` — so either spelling resolves to one
 *   true note (a two-word form is a two-token key, and the longest-match walk takes `do not` whole),
 *   and the note is written true of both shapes. Owners: `I'm` (M2), `don't` (M3), `doesn't` (M4),
 *   `didn't` (M5), `it's` (M7), `I'll` (M6, one variation at most). A row never pre-lists a sibling:
 *   M3's `don't` row does not carry `doesn't`, or M4's 3sg lesson becomes unreachable.
 * - **Straight `'` only** in authored text (the curly quote folds on the index, but `display` must be
 *   one spelling), and **no possessive `'s` in L1**: `Rohan's` would be a fresh surface needing its
 *   own row, and no L1 job needs one (`His name is Rohan`, not `My brother's name`).
 *
 * ### 3. Multi-token surfaces keep bare words free — and capture what is inside them
 *
 * As in en-es (`Me llamo`, `por favor`) and en-ar (`ṣabāḥ al-khayr`), a surface may span tokens and
 * the resolver takes the longest match first. Two consequences, both planning tools: a multi-token
 * surface claims NO bare part (`thank you` leaves `you` to M2's pronoun row), and it captures every
 * bare part wherever the phrase appears (`there is` swallows the `is` inside it, so a tap opens the
 * existential note, not `be`'s). The course's multi-token surfaces and their owners: `good morning` ·
 * `thank you` (M2); `get up` · `wake up` (M4); `going to` (M6); `there is` · `there are` · `next to` ·
 * `in front of` (M7); `how much` · `how many` · `Can I have` (M8). Each is named in its module's INDEX
 * SEAM note with the word it protects: `how` stays M2's (`How are you?`), `have` stays M4's
 * possession row (`Can I have` never touches it), `go` and `to` stay M4's and M3's — and because
 * `going to` is claimed as the PLAN marker, no display after M6 may write `going to` + a place;
 * movement is `go to` / `went to` / `will go to`.
 *
 * ### 4. Homographs — first occurrence wins, so every colliding surface has an owner
 *
 * English's commonest words are its worst homographs, and the index is cumulative with FIRST
 * OCCURRENCE WINS (`tools/content-build.ts`), so the earliest module to write a surface owns the note
 * every later learner sees. The owners, each stated again in that module's notes:
 *
 * - **`be`** — ONE row, opened by M1's first `is` (`My name is Rohan`) with `forms` `am · is · are`;
 *   later sentences' `am` / `are` are not re-deconstructed. M5 EXTENDS that row — `forms` gains
 *   `was · were`, the note gains the past — rather than opening a second `be` row the index could
 *   never reach for `is`.
 * - **`to`** — M3 (`want to` + verb), as a bare row; its note is written true of M4's `go to school`
 *   and M7's `to the shop` (को / तक) as well, since those inherit the key.
 * - **`do`** — M3, do-support; the note defines the helper AND the main verb करना. `does` / `doesn't`
 *   are M4's rows and `did` / `didn't` M5's — each again both jobs.
 * - **`like`** — M1's verb only; `like` = "similar to" stays out of L1.
 * - **`have`** — M4, possession only (`I have two brothers`, the state verb the `*I am having` trap
 *   needs); auxiliary `have` stays out of L1, `have tea` is written `drink tea`, and M8's request
 *   rides `Can I have` whole.
 * - **`a` / `an`** — M1, one row with both in `forms`; **`the`** — M3; a kind of thing in general, mass
 *   or plural, takes nothing (M1's `I like tea`).
 * - **`in` / `on` / `at`** — M4 (time), and M7's place uses inherit those rows, so M4's notes are
 *   written true of both seats (`on Monday` · `on the table`).
 * - **`it`** — M7 (the thing-pronoun, with `it's`); **`that`** — M9 (the conjunction of `I think
 *   that …`, with the pointing word defined in the same note); M7 and M8 point with `this` so the
 *   key is free. **`her`** — M6's object pronoun (`I'm meeting her tomorrow`), note true of the
 *   possessive too. **`so`** — M9's consequence word; the intensifier (`so tired`) stays out (`very`).
 * - **`he` / `she`** — M4 (the 3sg subject), with M10 returning to the split; **`and` / `but` /
 *   `also` / `then`** — M10's spend, so earlier modules keep one clause per sentence.
 *
 * ### Why the hi-en ladder teaches what it teaches
 *
 * The jobs are levels.json's, mirrored verbatim; the brief adds which Hindi→English delta each job
 * carries. SVO and the article land in M1 (the first sentence a learner writes puts `is` in the
 * middle and an `a` before `student`), inversion and the one `you` in M2, do-support and `want to`
 * in M3, third-person `-s` and the simple/continuous split in M4, the one-form past and `did` in M5,
 * the three futures in M6, prepositions-before-the-noun and `there is` in M7, `how much` / `how many`
 * and counting in M8, the one-connector rule in M9, and the never-dropped subject pronoun plus
 * `he` / `she` in M10. Kept deliberately OUT of L1: the present perfect and auxiliary `have`, `can`
 * outside the fixed `Can I have`, the possessive `'s`, the passive, comparatives (L2-M9), conditionals
 * (L3-M4), and `-ing` anywhere except M6's arrangements and a starred `*I am knowing`.
 *
 * There was no seam-proof fixture to replace: `content/hi-en/modules/` did not exist until #270
 * authored L1-M1 against the brief below, and #273 graduated the course out of `fixture: true`
 * — the fourth course shipping, all four courses briefed here.
 *
 * ## hi-mr L2: the four decisions, taken against the finished L1 (#295)
 *
 * The first L2 briefed anywhere: ten modules planned against the REAL cumulative L1 index —
 * 215 surfaces through L1-M10, maxSpan 1, rebuilt and read rather than remembered — and against
 * the L1 review chain (docs/08 open questions 1–22, docs/15 23–30, docs/19 31–40, docs/23
 * 41–48). The four decisions below are hi-mr L2's equivalents of hi-en's four, recorded in
 * `docs/26-hi-mr-L2-brief-decisions.md` and repeated in the notes, because a prompt only ever
 * shows an author the notes.
 *
 * ### 1. Language of fields — L2 keeps L1's split, field for field
 *
 * hi-mr writes `rules[].text` and word `note` in English, and every learner-facing line —
 * `cue`, `literal`, `trap`, `sound`, `usage`, `mistake.why`, `variations[].changed`, `mnemonic`
 * — in Hindi (Devanagari), with `glossEn` required on every sentence (the L2 is not English, so
 * #268's exemption does not apply). The English is the tolerated quirk of a course with one
 * bilingual learner (the hi-en section above forbids copying it INTO hi-en) — and mid-course is
 * the wrong place to fix a voice: an L2 module whose notes suddenly spoke Hindi would fork the
 * course's own conventions for zero pedagogy. L2 copies `content/hi-mr/modules/L1-M1.json`'s
 * split exactly.
 *
 * ### 2. Register — L1 taught तू as the default; L2 finally teaches WHEN
 *
 * docs/08 Q16 recorded the choice; L2-M1 is the module that pays for it: तू for a friend or
 * family your own age or younger, तुम्ही for elders, strangers and counters — and every L2
 * brief states which register its frames speak (M4, M7 and M8 talk to strangers: तुम्ही; M6's
 * plans are among friends: तू). Marathi has no दीजिए tier — the imperative stops at
 * तुम्ही + -आ, and politeness above it goes into words (जरा, कृपया) or the future question
 * (द्याल का?). The schema's register chip has exactly two values, `neutral` and `informal` — so
 * तू frames chip informal, and the formal end (कृपया, आभारी आहे) is carried by the `usage` line
 * in words. आपण stays the course's "we" (L1-M10's row): the very-formal "you" job (docs/08 Q17)
 * is named in prose, never a display subject.
 *
 * ### 3. Forms — L2 never edits an L1 file
 *
 * The additions-only invariant, made structural: a new SHAPE of an L1 lexeme (माझ्या, घरं,
 * जायचं, बोला…) is deconstructed in the L2 module that first shows it — its own row, its note
 * pointing back to the first-teach row — because the bare word's key is L1's forever (first
 * occurrence wins) and re-verifying shipped L1 files from every L2 issue would churn what the
 * gate froze. (docs/15 put दुकानाजवळ on दुकान's own L1 row; that was L1 repairing L1 — across
 * levels the rule flips.) Within L2 the docs/15 discipline continues: a first-teach row lists
 * the shapes its LEVEL shows (plan the wave, not the module), `[]` stays honest for invariables
 * and re-teaches, and a spoken contraction and its full form share one row — बोलतोय · बोलतेय ·
 * बोलतंय · बोलत — the hi-en `don't · do not` precedent. The participle -त is listed as a
 * single-token form of its verb's row, so the two-word spellings (बोलत आहे, चालत नाही) resolve
 * word by word — the -त form to the verb's row, आहे/नाही to M1's/M2's — and negation never
 * needs a new row.
 *
 * ### 4. Seams — hi-mr stays single-token, and the owners are decided up front
 *
 * maxSpan is 1 and stays 1: Devanagari GLUES what other courses span — postpositions
 * (स्टेशनला, चहापेक्षा, सगळ्यात), the continuous (बोलतोय), the purpose infinitive (जेवायला) —
 * so every fused form is a fresh single-token key owned by the module that first shows it, and
 * the multi-token tool (en-es's `Me llamo`) stays unused. The collisions, each named again in
 * its module's notes: बसा's row must NOT list the bare stem बस in `forms`, or M4's bus lands on
 * "sit"; प्यायला-as-purpose is spelled exactly like L1-M5's past प्यायला, whose row owns the
 * key, so the -आयला frame is shown on जेवायला/खायला and writes around it; या (M1) carries two
 * jobs in one note — "come (polite)" and the invite particle after -ऊ (जाऊ या, M6) — the hi-en
 * do-row precedent; कोण (M2) and कोणता (M9) are sibling keys whose notes cross-reference;
 * proper nouns (रोहन, पुणे, पुण्याला) never index (#61), so every direction anchors on a common
 * noun. L2 also pays L1's three recorded debts — दे (docs/15's M10 note) in M1, the counting
 * set (open question 28) across M5's table and M6's clock, and बोलणे (open question 29) in M7 —
 * while the three pinned L1 sweep misses (प्रिया, पाच, बोललो) STAND, because a module's index
 * is cumulative through itself and no L2 row reaches back into an L1 reader's screen. And what
 * first-occurrence-wins takes away, it also settles: आम्ही can never get a row of its own
 * (open question 23) — the आपण row keeps teaching the split.
 *
 * ### Why the hi-mr L2 ladder teaches what it teaches
 *
 * The jobs are levels.json's, mirrored verbatim; the brief adds which Hindi→Marathi delta each
 * job carries, sequenced so each pressure point lands in the module whose job cannot be done
 * without it: the two-step imperative and the आप→आपण trap in M1 (a request is addressed, and
 * must pick a register); तो/ती/ते and आहेत in M2 (describing a person forks Hindi's one वह by
 * gender); the full agreement paradigm — plurals at last — in M3; the place -ला and the
 * instrumental -ने in M4; मिळेल and the guest script in M5; the -ऊ या suggestion and
 * जमेल/चालेल in M6; the continuous -तोय in M7 (a phone call happens NOW); the -त नाही negative
 * and the मिळणे/सापडणे split in M8; -पेक्षा, सगळ्यात and की/किंवा in M9; and the third-person
 * ergative — त्याने/तिने, the ने withheld since L1-M5 — in M10, where a past-tense account
 * cannot dodge it. Kept deliberately OUT of L2: the genitive as a system (M2 shows one -चं
 * frame; L3 owns the rest), conditionals and reported speech (L3-M4/M5 per levels.json), the
 * passive, and the -ऊन converb — none of the ten jobs needs them. Bounds climb 8 → 10; pools
 * are authored to 12, the course's shipped size (#305).
