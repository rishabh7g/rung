# LLM review — hi-mr L2 (Conversations)

**This is an LLM review, not a native pass.** The author and reviewer is Claude (Opus 5), which
cannot hear Marathi and is not a native editor. It wrote the Marathi, the Hindi teaching prose and
the pronunciation glosses, then audited all three. `verified: true` rests on the repo owner's
standing authority, exactly as every earlier flip in this repo did (hi-mr L1, PR #190; en-es
#192–#194; en-ar #199–#201; en-ko docs/35–37); `verifiedBy` says so in words —
`"Claude Opus 5 — LLM review, authorised by repo owner"`. **No native gate exists for this
course.** The open questions at the bottom are the outstanding work, numbered on from the L1
chain (docs/08 1–22, docs/15 23–30, docs/19 31–40, docs/23 41–48).

One doc per course per level (docs/48 §B5): this file gains a section per authoring wave.

## The level, as planned

L2 was briefed in #295 against the finished L1 index and the L1 review chain; the four decisions
are `docs/26-hi-mr-L2-brief-decisions.md` and they are restated inside every module note, because
a prompt only ever shows an author the notes. Two things moved between briefing and authoring, and
both are recorded rather than silently absorbed:

- **The index figure.** The briefs were planned at 215 surfaces through L1-M10. The spoken pass of
  2026-09-05 (docs/40) added seven; the real figure at the start of authoring, rebuilt and read,
  is **222, maxSpan 1**. No seam moved — the seven are all spoken-register surfaces inside modules
  the briefs already owned. `tools/course-briefs.ts` and docs/26 now carry 222.
- **The register chip.** docs/26 §2 was written when the enum was `neutral | informal`, and it
  routed the formal tier into the `usage` line in words. #422 added `formal`. The decision stands;
  only the carrier moved, and docs/26 carries the addendum.

## Wave 1 — L2-M1 "Asking politely", L2-M2 "Describing people"

|                    | L2-M1 Asking politely                | L2-M2 Describing people   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| sentences          | 10                                   | 10                        |
| new word rows      | 12 of 25 allowed                     | 14 of 25 allowed          |
| index growth       | +12 surfaces (222 → 234)             | +28 surfaces (234 → 262)  |
| pool items         | 12                                   | 12                        |
| tokens per sentence | 3–6 (bounds 3–8)                    | 3–5 (bounds 3–8)          |
| enrichment         | full (all five blocks, every sentence) | full                    |
| `glossEn`          | every sentence                       | every sentence            |
| `literal`          | every sentence                       | every sentence            |
| register chips     | 5 `formal`, 4 `informal`, 1 `neutral` | 10 `neutral`             |
| prerequisites      | `[]`                                 | `["L2-M1"]`               |

The first content above L1 in any course. It proves the chain on a second level: the id grammar
(#417), the prompt CLI crossing the level boundary (`L2-M1`'s prompt was generated against
`L1-M10`'s real index), the M1–M3 enrichment law reading the module number and not the level, and
`prerequisites` staying inside the level — `L2-M1` lists `[]`, and the seal rule carries the
cross-level dependency.

### What the two modules teach

**L2-M1** is the register module, and its grammar is the imperative pair: bare stem for तू
(दे · कर · ये), stem + -आ for तुम्ही (द्या · करा · या · बसा). Hindi climbs three steps and Marathi
has two, so the loud rule is that there is no -इए tier to reach for — `*द्याजी`, `*करिये`,
`*बसिये` are starred in the rules and spent as mistakes on S04, S05 and S06. The course's best
false friend, आप ≠ आपण, is rule 3 and the mistake on S01. Softening above तुम्ही + -आ is bought
with words (जरा, कृपया) or with the polite-future question (द्याल का?, S03), never with a new
form. Thanks lands in three steps: थँक्यू named in prose and in a `trap`, धन्यवाद written (S09),
आभारी आहे above both (S10).

**L2-M2** pays the pronoun debt L1 left open (docs/19 Q40 — रोहन repeated because L1 taught no
तो). तो · ती · ते arrive as one row-set with two jobs, he/she/it and the far twins of L1-M8's
हा/ही/हे, and every note is written true of both. आहेत is the fourth cell of आहे and doubles as
respect (S04), and the honest family asymmetry — वडील on the respect-plural, आई singular and
intimate — is S04 against S05, with the `trap` naming it as closeness rather than disrespect. The
adjective split previews M3: उंच, लहान, हुशार never bend; चांगला and मोठा do. मूल is the
interference with a face — a child in the gender Hindi does not have (S09). The genitive is one
frame only (S10): माझ्या भावाचं नाव — the owner bends first, the ending agrees with the thing
owned, and the system itself is L3's.

### Seams held (docs/26 §4)

- **द्या stays L1-M8's row.** It appears in L2-M1 only inside दे's `forms`, so the index key still
  resolves to its first teach. Same for आहे in आहेत's `forms` (L1-M1 keeps it) and माझा in
  माझे/माझ्या's (L1-M1 keeps it).
- **बसा's row lists no bare बस.** `forms` is `[]` and the note says the तू form is spelled like
  the vehicle, so the बस key is left for L2-M4 to claim.
- **या carries both jobs in one note** — the तुम्ही imperative of येणे, and the invite particle
  after a -ऊ cell (जाऊ या) — so L2-M6's suggestions will not land on a "come" note that is false
  of them.
- **मदत is not spent here.** L2-M1's करा row names कृपया मदत करा as the same shape doing the same
  work, in prose; the key stays L2-M8's.
- **कोण is M2's**, and its note says it sits where the answer sits (the काय/कुठे law). L2-M9's
  कोणता is cross-referenced in the briefs, not merged.
- **Proper nouns ride unindexed** (#61): रोहन and प्रिया appear in displays and variations, never
  as deconstructed rows.
- **No L1 file was edited.** `git diff --stat content/hi-mr/modules/L1-*` is empty; the new shapes
  of L1 lexemes (माझे, माझ्या, आहेत, दे, कर) are deconstructed here with notes pointing back.

### Checks

- `npm run content:validate` — 92/92 ok, both modules included.
- `npm run content:build` (strict) ships them and reports the index counts above; every pool token
  resolves against L1 plus the module's own deconstructions, which is what the build enforces.
- `scripts/verify.sh` green.

### Open questions for a native pass — wave 1

49. **`कृपया खोलीत या` (M1-S07).** Grammatical, but a native invite is more often `आत या`. आत is
    unowned vocabulary at this point in the ladder (L2-M4 owns the direction words), so the room
    was used instead. Is the line natural enough to ship, or should M4 re-teach the invite?
50. **`मी आभारी आहे` (M1-S10).** Without an addressee (`मी तुमचा आभारी आहे`) this reads slightly
    bare. तुमचा is L3's genitive-as-a-system work. Does the bare line stand?
51. **थँक्यू is named, never written.** The `trap` on M1-S09 says everyday Pune says थँक्यू. Is
    keeping it out of `display` the right call, or does the course owe the learner the line it
    will actually hear?
52. **The respect-plural default on वडील (M2-S04).** Shipped as always-plural. Is there a register
    or region where `माझा वडील` is ordinary, and if so, does the note over-claim?
53. **मूल vs मुलगा/मुलगी (M2-S08, S09).** The module teaches all three. Does the neuter मूल sound
    natural in `हे मूल चांगलं आहे`, or is बाळ the word a Marathi speaker reaches for?
54. **The pronunciation glosses.** Written, not heard: `बहीण = ब‑ही‑ण`, `भावाचं = भा‑वा‑चं`,
    `उंच = उं‑च`. Every one needs an ear.

## Wave 2 — L2-M3 "Describing things", L2-M4 "Getting around", L2-M5 "Food and hosting"

|                     | L2-M3 Describing things | L2-M4 Getting around | L2-M5 Food and hosting |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| sentences           | 10                      | 10                   | 10                     |
| new word rows       | 13 of 25 allowed        | 15 of 25 allowed     | 15 of 25 allowed       |
| index growth        | +38 (262 → 300)         | +28 (300 → 328)      | +22 (328 → 350)        |
| pool items          | 12                      | 12                   | 12                     |
| tokens per sentence | 3–7                     | 3–6                  | 3–5                    |
| enrichment          | full                    | full                 | full                   |
| register chips      | 10 `neutral`            | 6 `formal`, 4 `neutral` | 6 `formal`, 4 `neutral` |

M3 is the last module the M1–M3 enrichment law compels; M4 and M5 carry all five blocks anyway,
because that is what every hi-mr module has done since L1-M1 and a learner should not feel the
ladder thin out mid-level.

### What the three modules teach

**L2-M3** walks the whole agreement grid where L1 only flashed corners of it. The law itself is
Hindi's own and is tagged `free` — -आ bends, everything else stands still — and the delta is which
endings: -ा · -ी · -ं singular, -े · -्या · -ी plural. The two loud cells are the feminine plural
(Hindi's -ी serves one and many; Marathi bends to -्या, S04) and the neuter plural that is spelled
exactly like the feminine singular (S05, S10 — `मोठी खोली` beside `मोठी घरं`, shown as a pair in
one `variations` block). Nouns bend along the same seam (घरं, पुस्तकं, खोल्या, बाटल्या), each new
plural pointing back to its L1 first-teach. Colours are the vocabulary spend and rehearse the split
themselves: काळा, पांढरा, निळा, हिरवा, नवा, जुना bend; लाल and स्वस्त do not.

**L2-M4** is two glued endings and a direction set. -ला on the destination over L1-M7's oblique
bend (दुकान → दुकानाला), starred against Hindi's bare noun; -ने on the vehicle (बस से → बसने),
with the note deliberately narrow — "by/with" only, because the past-tense job of -ने is L2-M10's.
`कसं जायचं?` points L1-M3's -आयचं shape at an impersonal job. जा is flagged as the one road verb
whose तू and तुम्ही forms share a shape, which is the rest point in a module of imperatives.

**L2-M5** is the hosting script and the refusal script. मिळेल का? is the order-as-question; its
note claims only मिळणे's half of Hindi's मिलना, leaving सापडणे's half to M8. घ्या is द्या's twin
in the other direction. The refusal ladder is नको → आता नको → पुरे → पोट भरलं, and पुरे carries
the module's one homograph warning: a Hindi speaker's "बस!" at a Marathi table is the vehicle or
the sit-verb. जेवणे is one verb where Hindi needs two words, and जेवलात का? is shipped as the
care-question it actually is. The purpose infinitive arrives on जेवायला and खायला only —
प्यायला-as-purpose is spelled exactly like L1-M5's past प्यायला, so it is written around, not
shown.

### Seams held

- **The बस key is the vehicle's** (M4-S06), as M1's बसा row promised; sit-बस never appears in a
  display and is named only in prose.
- **-ने's past-tense job is not opened.** The rule text says so in one clause and points at M10.
- **मिळणे does not claim "find".** M8's सापडणे is named in the rule and in the `trap`.
- **प्यायला is not re-used as a purpose form** — the key stays L1-M5's past.
- **तीन · चार · पाच** land on one row (M5-S07), paying docs/15 open question 28: पाच was a pinned
  miss in the L1 surface pass and now resolves.
- **A shown surface is a taught surface.** Every `display` in every sentence, variation and pool
  item of the five L2 modules resolves against that module's own cumulative index — checked
  mechanically, the #282 discipline. The only exceptions are proper nouns (रोहन, प्रिया), which
  ride unindexed by #61, and `mistake.display`, which is deliberately wrong Marathi.
- **मोठा's paradigm has one home.** M2 opened the row, so M3's six cells were added to M2's
  `forms` rather than opened a second time — the docs/15 discipline. The same for चांगला.

### Open questions for a native pass — wave 2

55. **`ही भाजी स्वस्त आहे, ती महाग आहे` (M3-S07).** Two clauses joined by a comma with no
    conjunction. Natural, or does Marathi want `पण` here — which L1 never taught?
56. **`खोल्या` for rooms (M3-S06).** Shipped as the everyday plural. Is `खोल्या` what a Pune
    speaker says of their own house, or is `रूम` the honest spoken word?
57. **`जरा सांगा, स्टेशनला कसं जायचं?` (M4-S01).** Is the `जरा सांगा` opener what a stranger is
    actually addressed with, or is `एक्स्क्यूज मी` / `माफ करा` more true?
58. **गाडी covering both a car and a train (M4-S08).** The note says the sentence disambiguates.
    Does that hold in speech, or does a learner need `रेल्वे` before L3?
59. **`पुरे` at the table (M5-S04).** Shipped as the refusal word, with `बस` warned against. Is
    `पुरे` alone enough, or is `पुरे झालं` the line that is actually said?
60. **`जेवलात का?` as a greeting (M5-S05).** Written as the care-question. Is the polite past
    right for a stranger, or is it reserved for people you know?
61. **Every pronunciation gloss in this wave** — `निळ्या`, `पोळ्या`, `थांबा`, `रिक्षाने`,
    `जेवायला` — is written, not heard.

## Wave 3 — L2-M6…M10, and the level closes

|                | M6 Making plans | M7 On the phone | M8 When something goes wrong | M9 Comparing | M10 Telling what happened |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| sentences      | 10              | 10              | 10                           | 10           | 10 accounts (2–4 sentences each) |
| new word rows  | 10              | 12              | 15                           | 10           | 12                        |
| index growth   | +11 (350 → 361) | +15 (361 → 376) | +27 (376 → 403)              | +16 (403 → 419) | +22 (419 → 441)        |
| pool items     | 12              | 12              | 12                           | 12           | 12                        |
| enrichment     | full            | full            | full                         | full         | full                      |
| register chips | 9 `informal`, 1 `neutral` | 10 `neutral` | 4 `formal`, 6 `neutral` | 2 `formal`, 8 `neutral` | 9 `informal`, 1 `neutral` |

**M6** is assembly, not new grammar: the -ऊ या suggestion frame out of pieces the learner already
owns, with the ask/propose split (जाऊ का? against जाऊ या) as the delta Hindi folds into one चलें.
जमणे carries the polite refusal and the clock hours land, paying the second instalment of docs/15
Q28. It is the level's first sustained तू module, and the chips say so honestly. येशील finally
appears in a display — docs/15 Q25 asked whether showing it helps; the brief said here it earns it.

**M7** spends the whole module on one tense: the glued continuous बोलतोय · बोलतेय · बोलतंय, with
the unknown-caller neuter as the interference (Hindi has no ungendered cell to reach for). The
written two-word form बोलत आहे is shown beside the spoken one so both resolve. The about-to job of
the plain present (मी फोन ठेवतो, मी नंतर फोन करतो) is the cheapest lesson in the level — a new use
of a shape owned since L1-M4 — and बोलणे's rows open at last, the docs/15 Q29 debt.

**M8** is the survival module: सापडणे against मिळणे (the mirror of M5's seam), the -त नाही frame
where nothing agrees, and L1-M5's gender law recycled through हरवला · संपले, against विसरलो which
agrees with the person instead. जरा मदत करा · हळू बोला · जरा पुन्हा सांगा are the lines this app
exists to hand over.

**M9** is the level's rest point: -पेक्षा glued (with the oblique bend, so भावापेक्षा costs
nothing once भावाचं is owned), जास्त/कमी invariable, सगळ्यात parseable on sight, and the की/किंवा
pair split by sentence type — L1-M9's कारण/म्हणून device reborn.

**M10** brings the course's oldest debt due: the ने L1-M5 fenced off (docs/08 Q20) arrives as
त्याने · तिने · त्यांनी, and the object agreement is unchanged, which S03 and S07 show by holding
the subject still while the verb moves three times. भेटणे takes -ला on the person met and agrees
with the meeter; सांगितलं is flagged irregular. Format is L1-M10's turns grown up: accounts on
आधी · मग · शेवटी, past tense only, and the smallest new-word spend of the level.

### Two brief claims the build corrected

- **झालं was not an L1 row.** The M8 brief says "काम, काय, झालं, नाही all stay L1's rows"; the
  rebuilt index says L1 never taught झालं. It is opened here as its own row (M8-S01) with the
  होणे paradigm, and M10 re-shows it doing the listener's job in मग काय झालं?.
- **आलो was not taught either.** L1 taught आला · आली · आलं (third person) and the future येईन,
  but never the मी cell of the past. M10-S05 opens it, forms आलो · आले, pointing at येणे's family.

Both are additions, not edits: no L1 file changed in this level, and
`git diff --stat content/hi-mr/modules/L1-*` is empty across all three waves.

### The level, closed

- 10 modules, 100 sentences, 120 comprehension items, 441 cumulative surfaces (222 at the start of
  the level, so L2 added 219).
- `content/hi-mr/levels.json` drops `draft` on L2: the level is authored, and `hasContent` is
  recomputed by the build.
- The strict build (`npm run content:build`, no flags) ships `hi-mr: 20 modules (L1-M1..M10,
  L2-M1..M10)`.

### Open questions for a native pass — wave 3

62. **`आपण` for "let's" (M6).** The course teaches आपण as the inclusive we (L1-M10) and uses it as
    the subject of every suggestion. Is आपण जाऊ या what friends actually say, or is the bare
    जाऊ या more common?
63. **`जमेल` versus `चालेल` (M6).** Shipped as: जमेल asks whether a person can make it, चालेल
    whether a time is acceptable. Is that split real in speech, or do they overlap?
64. **`बोलतंय` for an unknown caller (M7-S02).** Written as ordinary politeness. Does it ever
    sound cold, and is कोण आहे? the safer opener?
65. **`मी नंतर बोलतो` as a sign-off (M7-S10).** Is this the phrase, or is ठेवतो the only natural
    closing?
66. **`अडचण आली` (M8-S10).** Placed in L1-M9's कंटाळा आला frame. Is अडचण झाली heard as often?
67. **`सगळ्यात` (M9-S05).** Shipped as the everyday superlative. Does spoken Pune prefer
    सर्वात in some registers, and would a learner be marked by either?
68. **`वडिलांनी` (M10-S04 variation).** The respect-plural ergative on a named noun. Correct as
    spelled?
69. **The whole M10 format.** Four-sentence accounts assembled from L1 and L2 vocabulary only —
    do they read as something a person would actually say, or as an exercise?
70. **Every pronunciation gloss in the level** is written, not heard. A native pass should read
    all one hundred `sound` lines aloud before any of them is trusted.
